## ⚡ Project Setup

### Backend

1. Navigate to backend folder:

```bash
cd backend

2. Install dependencies:

npm install

3.Create a .env file in backend/:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

4.Start the server:

npm run dev
Server will run at: http://localhost:5000

# Frontend

1.Navigate to frontend folder:

cd frontend


2.Install dependencies:

npm install


3.Start the React app:

npm start


App will run at: http://localhost:3000

📌 API Documentation

Swagger UI: http://localhost:5000/api-docs
(All endpoints documented with request/response examples)

Postman Collection (optional): backend/docs/postman_collection.json

🔹 Scalability Considerations

Microservices: Split Auth, Tasks, Users into separate services for better modularity and maintainability.

Caching: Use Redis for session management and frequently accessed queries to reduce database load.

Load Balancing: Distribute traffic across multiple instances using Nginx or HAProxy.

Database Scaling: Implement MongoDB sharding and replication for high availability and horizontal scaling.

Containerization: Use Docker to containerize services and Kubernetes for orchestration, auto-scaling, and deployments.

CDN: Serve frontend static assets via a CDN for lower latency.

Monitoring & Logging: Implement structured logging (Winston) and monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana) for performance insights.

📝 Notes

JWT tokens are stored in localStorage on the frontend.

Only admins can manage users and see all tasks.

Users can only CRUD their own tasks.

This README includes:

1. **Setup instructions** for backend and frontend.  
2. **Swagger/Postman API docs link**.  
3. **Scalability considerations**.  
4. **Folder structure & notes**.  

---

If you want, I can also **write a small "Admin Panel" note in README** explaining how to access admin-only routes in the frontend dashboard so it’s completely submission-ready.  

Do you want me to add that?
